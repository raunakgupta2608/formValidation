The answer to the first two question is mentioned in the file Youkraft.docs

1) First simply clone the repository in some folder
command :- git clone https://github.com/raunakgupta2608/formValidation.git .

2) After cloning install node modules 
command :- npm i

3) Run the app 
command :- npm start
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

As after multiple follow ups the clarity on bonus section was not given so I implemented the project without bonus.
I know about Redux and have made projects using it.

Thanks,
